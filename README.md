# Personal Portfolio

This is my very first development project ever. Made for [**Coderhouse's Web Development Course**](https://www.coderhouse.com/online/desarrollo-web-online) in 2021. Sponsored by [**Refokus Agency**](https://refokus.webflow.io/).

## About the Project

I chose to create a personal portfolio and make it a landing page with several sections you can navigate with the help of a navbar with scrollspy.

Before start coding and according to the course's guidelines, we needed to make a quick wireframe of how the website should be. In my case i preffered to just make a quick and simple design in Figma with its responsive view.

[**Check the design here**](https://www.figma.com/file/ZvioRQgOmB1rq5h5xCG77V/Desarrollo-Web-Coderhouse-FedericoLuna?node-id=42%3A962)

So, i built the website with HTML & CSS, then added Bootstrap on where i saw it useful (e.g in the Project's section where a i used CSS grids) and finally pushed it live uising Webhost.

### Style Management
For a better control of the style i used SASS and ran the following system:

• A main-style.scss where i imported all the partials and set the rooting styles.</br>
• A group of .scss called **Styleguide** where i created a partial for colors, texts and components(containers, sections, buttons, etc.).</br>
• A group of .scss called **Sections** to apply styles to each section on the website.

Feedback is welcome!
